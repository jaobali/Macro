# Task Automation with Macros

This project includes a .mrf file developed during my first job. Because of this, some details were omitted. The program was developed to automate registrations in a system. The registration data was stored in an Excel file. The work, initially estimated to take 3 months, was completed in 10 days, working completely automatically.
